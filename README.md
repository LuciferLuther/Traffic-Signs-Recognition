## Project Description
In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.

## Data Overview
- The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. 
- It is further classified into 43 different classes. 
- The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. 
- The size of the dataset is around 600 MB. 
- The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.

<p> 
Our ‘train’ folder contains 43 folders each representing a different class.
